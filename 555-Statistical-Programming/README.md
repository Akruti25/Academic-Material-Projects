## ST 555: Statistical Programming I
An introduction to programming and data management using SAS, the industry standard for statistical practice. Detailed discussion of the program data vector and data handling techniques that are required to apply statistical methods. Topics are based on the current content of the Base SAS Certification Exam and typically include: importing, validating, and exporting of data files; manipulating, subsetting, and grouping data; merging and appending data sets; basic detail and summary reporting; and code debugging. Additional topics with practical applications are also introduced, such as graphics and advanced reporting. Statistical methods for analyzing data are not covered in this course. Regular access to a computer for homework and class exercises is required. Previous exposure to SAS is not expected.
